        <h3> Our Signs/Our Process </h3>
        <p5> 
            (process for how you make your signs and why they are special ex supplies, plywood, solar lights, 
            handpainted) (here is an example can be changed)

            Unlike our competition, our signs are madu up of hand painted, sturdy, cut plywood and are around 5ft tall!
            We also place solar lights so your signs can be seen even at night!

            We place the signs the night before the event, the sign stays with you for around 48 hours and we’ll come by 
            the night after your selected day.
